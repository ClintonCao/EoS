\begin{enumerate}
\item  {\bf Introduction} \\ 
Malware is short for malicious software and it is used to cause harm to computer systems.
A well known example of malware is a Trojan horse. This is a software that hides its
true intention from the user of the system. Some other forms of malware include adware,
ransomware, spyware, and much more.\\
All these type of malware has lead to various security issues e.g. privacy breach. The
privacy of the user can be compromised by having the malware read files that contain
personal information of the user, or the adversary can gain access to the webcam without
permission. Another security issue that malware can cause is time and financial issues.\\
Let's look at the following example: The adversary has designed a ransomware, with
the goal of earning money from the victims. Once the victim's computer is infected with the
this ransonmare, it blocks the whole computer and does not allow the user of the computer
to do anything. The only way to unlock the computer is to pay the adversary. The price,
that the user will have to pay, might be very high. Another way to unlock the computer is
to look for a professional that can remove the ransomware. The owner of the computer will
first have to find the professional and then wait for them to remove the ransomware. This
costs time and money.

\item {\bf Ideal Metrics} \\
The ideal metrics for security decision metrics makers would be to cover the following
aspects: the cost of security, benefit of security, and security level. The security level can
be further divided into the following categories controls, vulnerabilities, incidents and
prevented losses. In our case, we want to increase the security level by having less systems
getting infected with malwares. Metrics are needed that would provide the following
information:
\begin{itemize}
\item How likely a software is a malware?
\item How likely a domain is a malicious domain?
\item What kind of behaviours of the user is most likely to lead them getting their system
infected?
\item What kind of system are most likely to get infected?
\item Does most malwares originate from the same country?
\item What do most people do when their system is infected?
\item How hard it is to remove the malware?

\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Existing Metrics Used in Practice} \\
We have taken a look at different metrics (related to malwares) that are used in practice. A
way to find malware on Android is to use the software complexity metrics, as proposed by
Protsenko and Müller [2]. An example of software complexity metric is Mcabe's Cyclomatic
Complexity.\\
NoticeBored has also provided different metrics that can be used to measure and report
malwares [1] An example is the awareness metrics. With awareness metrics, people are
evaluated on how familiar they are with certain malwares and whether they understand
the risks. Another example is the coverage of antivirus software. This metrics evaluates
how many systems are protected with an antivirus software. \\
